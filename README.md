# Dashboard

## Goal

The goal of this project is a fully customizable and extendable dashboard/startpage, with modules like clock, weather, todo tasks, bookmarks, calendar, ... (see also my [ideas](#design-and-ideas))

Usually, I wait for a MVP before releasing a project. This project will be developed in public from Day 1. I document my progress and (knowledge) insights in the [journal](JOURNAL.md), while the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) describes the actual project features.

The current state of the project is available at [dashboard.darekkay.com](https://dashboard.darekkay.com).

## Motivation

Why build yet another dashboard app?

Most popular apps (like [Momentum](https://momentumdash.com/)) are neither open-source nor customizable to a degree that I'd like it to be. On the other hand, most open-source projects seem to be outdated.

Finally, a new project is a great opportunity to learn new concepts. For this project, I mainly want to try out the following:

1. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I'm being late to the party with this one.
2. Reactive programming using [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/). The data for each module may come from different places (service, local storage etc.), so it sounds like a good use case.

## Design and Ideas

The first milestone is a dashboard framework ("grid") with some simple, static modules (no external data, yet). The app and module configuration will be included in a simple config file. The result will be a static HTML page, like a custom browser [startpage](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages).

The next step will be to integrate 3rd party providers. I'd like to store as few data as possible on the server side and use local storage whenever possible.

### Feature ideas

- [x] Themes support. Because noone will bat an eye without a Dark Modeâ„¢.
- [] Use a real login to restrict access to sensitive data, especially when integrating 3rd party providers.
- [x] Reorder modules within the UI instead of using a config file (Drag and Drop).
- [] Use a monorepo (lerna) to split this project into a core and individual modules.

### Implemented widgets

| type      | description           |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| text      | Notes field           |
| date-time | Current date and time |
| search    | Web search            |

The configuration options for each widget are listed [here](docs/widgets.md).

### Widget/integration ideas

- [x] Current date and time
- [] Current weather and forecast
- [] Bookmarks
- [x] Search (for different search engines)
- [x] Notes
- [] Calendar / next events
- [] Daily message (quote, image, tip)
- [] Todo tasks (integration with 3rd party, like Todoist, Wunderlist or GitHub Issues)
  ...

All contributors are highly welcome, especially designers. If you want to collaborate on this project, just give me a [note](mailto:hello@darekkay.com).

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (Typescript preset).

Notice: I'm using `yarn`, but you may use `npm` as well.

1. Install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

2. Start app:

```bash
yarn start
```

3. Open [http://localhost:42007](http://localhost:42007) to view the app in the browser.

The `package.json` file contains other useful scripts, which you can execute using `yarn <command>` or `npm run <command>`:

| Command   | Description                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| build     | Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. |
| format    | Reformat all files with `prettier`.                  |
| generate  | Generate boilerplate code (components, widgets).     |
| lint:fix  | Run ESLint, apply automatic fixes if possible.       |
| storybook | Start Storybook                                      |
| test      | Run tests and check test coverage.                   |

The `master` branch is (manually) deployed to [dashboard.darekkay.com](https://dashboard.darekkay.com).
