There's a new widget for displaying images! The URL is configurable in the widget's settings modal. Nothing fancy, but there's finally some color on the Dashboard ðŸŽ¨.

I've also started working on a more complex widget (spoiler alert: it's about weather). I've done some more refactorings and improvements along the way to make the development easier. This includes extracting some boilerplate code, fixing the saga model and updating/adding file generators. I've also enabled GitLab CI, so I get an early feedback before making an official release on GitHub.
