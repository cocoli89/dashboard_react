The announced widget drawer is now implemented. This means, all available widgets (date/time, notes, web search) can be placed onto the dashboard and moved/resized within the UI. Removing the widgets is not yet possible, though.

I've added multi-language support. Currently, English (default) and German are available. I've used [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) to compare it to the more popular [react-intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl) which I'm using at work. So far it's really nice to use.

I've also included [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for development, a tool to preview UI components. It helped me already to find and fix some small issues.

Animations are now disabled if the user [prefers not to see any](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/03/prefers-reduced-motion).
