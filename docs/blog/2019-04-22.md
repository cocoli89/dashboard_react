I haven't made much functional progress in the last month as I've been mainly working on my other project: [Tip of the Day](https://tips.darekkay.com/). It is relevant to the dashboard, though, as I wish to connect both projects. The idea is to have a widget which displays a random tip every day (e.g. "country of the day"). I've also made some progress under the hood and made the text widget editable (the content is not stored yet, though).
