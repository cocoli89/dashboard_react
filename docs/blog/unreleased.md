It's now possible to export&import all user data. This enables multiple things:

1. Data backup. The data is your. Every service should provide a backup feature.
2. Manual syncing user data across computers. Dashboard still doesn't have any real server behind it (apart from the static serving part). While this is nice (no login required, privacy by default), it makes it harder to use it on multiple devices. A manual backup&restore makes it easier.
3. Create and save different use cases. That's nice both for development and showcases.
