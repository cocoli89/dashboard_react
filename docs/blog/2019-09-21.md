# 2019-09-21 (1.0.8)

Every widget can now be removed from the Dashboard. The last missing part of personalization is a settings dialog, so the user can select another search engine for example.

As I had previously copied the Button component from my other projects, it did not follow the new CSS variable approach to support different themes. The migration was not as trivial, because I could not use the `darken` and `transparentize` SCSS functions with CSS variables anymore. Converting the colors into HSL made the transition easier, though. Now Dashboard support different Button colors for the light and dark themes.

Now that [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com/) supports open source projects, I've migrated all my projects from travis-ci.org. The GitHub integration automatically checks each commit and PR and submits a [report](https://github.com/darekkay/dashboard/runs/230810744) directly on GitHub. I've also played around with the new [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) after getting into the Beta. While it's quite powerful, I still prefer Travis CI and GitLab CI due to the native yarn support.
