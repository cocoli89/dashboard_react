There is a new widget for showing the current date and time. Additionally, the state is now persisted across the sessions. Under the hood I've added [redux-observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable) to manage side effects and I've played around with the new [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/../hooks-intro.html).
