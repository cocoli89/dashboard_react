Now there's support for color themes! I've used CSS variables, so it's easy to switch values at runtime (try out the preview button). There's also a new shiny favicon, based on [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/). Finally, I've introduced React's [error boundaries](https://reactjs.org/../error-boundaries.html) so the app doesn't crash if a single widget throws any error.
