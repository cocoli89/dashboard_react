The journey begins :rocket:

With zero practical TypeScript experience, I've had some issues setting up the project, despite using a [boilerplate](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To get started, I've migrated three common JS components from my other app (button, link, icon). I've checked some best practices and popular Typescript/React projects, trying to do it the right wayâ„¢ (e.g. correct types).

I'm looking forward to experiencing the praised improvement over vanilla JavaScript. My IDE of choice, IntelliJ IDEA, supports TypeScript types for popular projects, so I've already got a good IntelliSense even without TypeScript .

The [CI pipeline](https://travis-ci.org/darekkay/dashboard) is on, and the project is already [live](https://dashboard.darekkay.com) (not much is going on, though).
