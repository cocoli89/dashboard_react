# Dashboard

![](./assets/img/1.1.1.png)

## Goal

The goal of this project is a fully customizable and extendable dashboard/startpage, with modules like clock, weather, todo tasks, bookmarks, calendar, etc. The user should be able to view all important information on a single page.

Usually, I wait for a MVP before releasing a project. This project is being [developed in public](https://github.com/darekkay/dashboard) from Day 1. I document my progress and (knowledge) insights in the blog, while the changelog describes the actual project features.

The current state of the project is available at [dashboard.darekkay.com](https://dashboard.darekkay.com).

## Motivation

Why build yet another dashboard app?

Most popular apps are neither open-source nor customizable to a degree that I'd like it to be. On the other hand, most open-source projects seem to be outdated.

A new project is also a great opportunity to learn new concepts.

## Features

- ☑ Themes support. Because noone will bat an eye without a Dark Mode™.
